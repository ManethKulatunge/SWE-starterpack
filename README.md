# SWE-starterpack
My brother just started university and I wanted to create and share a list of tips/resources for him! Hopefully others can benefit too!

Software Engineering, Data Science and Machine Learning are three fields that you can't avoid hearing once you start a program as a Computer Science student. I personally haven't explored Data Science and Machine Learning as much because I was very much interested in Product and Software Engineering from the start. The interesting part about software engineering is that it's a much more general technical role in comparison to something like Data Engineering and Data Science so it allows people who ventured into those fields, a clear path back to the role. Most of the larger companies assess how you think about problems rather than you knowing a million different technologies while smaller/medium sized companies look into specific technologies (for eg: A Web Developer role at a startup could interview you about very specific JavaScript concepts). 

These resources and tips are generally relevant for most people who are in technical roles and definetely might help build a portfolio for a Big Tech company. But I also think it allows you to have the option of being more technically sound in Software Development in case you want to explore smaller/medium sized companies too.

## Exploring in SWE

Once you get into Software Engineering and/or Development, you will hear terms like Mobile Development, Front End Development, Backend Development, and Full Stack Development. It's very overwhelming initially so I would recommend the following steps.

1. Come up with an idea for a personal project involving programming
1. Learn the techologies related to it 
1. Build the Project

Let me expound on these. 

### Coming up with an idea for a personal project

I'm sure the question pops up. Why are personal projects important? 

I'm glad you asked. If you look at the resumes of every New Grad Software Engineer and/or Intern that came out of college you will see a big and loud **Projects** section and the reason is because it demonstrates interest outside classwork and that's what helps you differentiate yourself from the rest of the applicants that apply for SWE roles. 

In your first year or so I would recommend spending less time on the idea phase especially if ideas come slower to you. It can be simpler, more digestable projects. My first project was on a very fundamental level just outputting hardcoded captions for pictures. I made it look fancy with the technical theatrics but that's essentially what it was on the angle of ideas. It's obviously important to have better ideas down the line to stand out even further but I have seen a lot of people get caught up in cycles of perfectionism so I think it's more important to get a project under your belt. 

As Gayle McDowell (who I will introduce you to later) said 
> It doesn't matter too much what it is. The important thing is that you're coding. Not only will this develop your technical skills and practical experience, your initiative will impress companies. 

The idea can even be related to few of your favourite ideas. For eg: If blockchain is your jam, you can think of building a decentralised application to solve a specific problem. Or honestly if that seems far out of reach for now you can even just start building your website. Important part is to GET STARTED. 


### Learning techologies

This is probably going to be one of the more interesting parts of the process as a budding developer because you start with a clean slate. You have no technologies under you belt and this is when everything changes. I would say the most ideal way to do a project is to think of an idea and then figure out the technologies and the domains you will be working on but sometimes when it gets hard to come up with ideas, I think think of a platform or the type of application might help narrow down the idea generation process.
