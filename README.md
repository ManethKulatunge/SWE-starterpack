# SWE-starterpack
My brother just started university and I wanted to create and share a list of tips/resources for him! Hopefully others can benefit too!

Software Engineering, Data Science and Machine Learning are three fields that you can't avoid hearing once you start a program as a Computer Science student. I personally haven't explored Data Science and Machine Learning as much because I was very much interested in Product and Software Engineering from the start. The interesting part about software engineering is that it's a much more general technical role in comparison to something like Data Engineering and Data Science so it allows people who ventured into those fields, a clear path back to the role. Most of the larger companies assess how you think about problems rather than you knowing a million different technologies while smaller/medium sized companies look into specific technologies (for eg: A Web Developer role at a startup could interview you about very specific JavaScript concepts). 

These resources and tips are generally relevant for most people who are in technical roles and definetely might help build a portfolio for a Big Tech company. But I also think it allows you to have the option of being more technically sound in Software Development in case you want to explore smaller/medium sized companies too.

## Exploring in SWE

Once you get into Software Engineering and/or Development, you will hear terms like Mobile Development, Front End Development, Backend Development, and Full Stack Development. It's very overwhelming initially so I would recommend the following steps.

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
